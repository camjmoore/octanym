- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on revitalizing a group project I contributed to called secret family recipes. Originally as the more senior member on the front-end team I established a git workflow that enabled us to work on our own branches and provided feedback to my team-mates on how their web components should be organized. Some time after the completion of the project I learned how to implement a RESTful API in Nodejs using express and knexjs, and after reflecting on what I thought could have been done better on the back-end I redesigned the API and database tables. I'm currently deciding what state-management to implement on the front-end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning webGL and Threejs and having a lot of fun exploring the world of 3D UI and shaders. My [portfolio](http://cameronjmoore.com/) was built following a Threejs tutorial from one of my favorite [youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/user/flintyara/featured)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that has to do with pushing the boundaries of UI interactivity using React, webGL or Threejs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with comprehending the breadth of the web development landscape, the history, the legacy and where I as a 'modern' web dev fit in to all of that! - to put it simply: I'm open to mentorship!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects! I hope to learn from my past mistakes and I am eager to 'fail better'
